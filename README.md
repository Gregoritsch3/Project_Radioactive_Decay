# Project_Radioactive_Decay
An analytical (system of coupled ODEs), numerical (Runge-Kutta 4, Newton-Raphson) and stochastic (Monte Carlo) treatment of the chained radioactive decay of Bi[210, 83] into Po[210,84], as well as the emission of alpha-particles. Associated comments and paper are in Croatian. All calculations performed under the assumption of a constant decay rate, which postulate the author doesn't necessarily accept.
